# 1. Project

## 1.1 Overview


## 1.2 Links

[Application](https://dsu-food-bank.herokuapp.com/)
[Source code](https://github.com/parthsw/dsu-food-bank)

## 1.3 Framework Customization

The application is bootstraped using the [ngx-rocket](https://github.com/ngx-rocket/generator-ngx-rocket) enterprise level project generator. The generated boilerplate code has been extensively customized to accommodate our application need. It is divided in various logical modules to support the application features and are lazily loaded to improve the performance. The architecture is fairly scalable for future extensions.

The global stylesheets are partitioned in different partials to handle entities such as colors, typography, variables, reset, components, etc... Moreover, the build system includes auto-formatting and linting steps before generating the production build.

To conclude, Angular provides a modern, scalable, and modular architecture for the front-end development. As it is an opinionated framework, it encompasses everything that a web application needs. Furthermore, I have a fair share of experience with the framework working in enterprise level projects.

## 2.3 Design Decision

The section describes the chosen color palette and fonts.

### 2.3.1 Color Palatte

Color palette of the application is primarily derived from the dribble shot used on the landing page. It is a minimalistic rendition with default color white and below shades of blue and orange extracted from the shot:

| UI Element                      | Color Code |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Text + Links                    | #2d316b    |
| Primary button + Input + Footer | #0e0d3a    |
| Sub-footer                      | #06061d    |
| Action button                   | #e86317    |
| Image placeholder               | #ededed    |

All of them are incremental shades of blue except the action button. The later one uses a shade of orange to clearly attract the attention.

### 2.3.2 Typography

The application uses two variants of [Montserrat Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat), Black and Regular. Currently, all the `<h1>` elements of the application uses the Black variant, while everything else is being rendered with the regular form.

### 2.3.3 Design Principles

The application is designed keeping the following design principles in mind:

- 7 Â± 2 Principle - The navigation bar only consist of seven items allowing users to retain.
- The 3-click rule - Designed the workflow in a way that requires minimum clicks to reach to a destination.
- Clear & Concise - All the labels and interactive buttons are clearly labeled.
- Appropriate Feedback - User receives an appropriate feedback to find their way back if they get lost or make a mistake.
- Content hierarchy - The app has clear and concise focus on content hierarchy. It provides clear emphasis on primary and secondary elements on a given page. (I.e., Organization of product name and category) All pages have an organized content having clear visual hierarchy.

## 2.4 Responsiveness + Testing

The application is tested for features and responsiveness with below set of devices and browsers:

- Asus VivoBook - Google Chrome, IE Edge, Firefox
- Nokia 5.1 Plus - Google Chrome
- Redmi Note 5 - Google Chrome
- One Plus 7 pro - Google Chrome

Note: The app is designed using modern CSS concepts such as grid and flex, which is supported by most of the browsers. However, Internet Explorer does not support all features of them, and therefore, you may not have a best experience while browsing the site in IE. I may add IE polyfills in the future, if time permits.

## 2.5 Content

See the section `Sources Used` to get details about images and content attribution.

## 2.6 W3C compliance

The application passes the W3C compliance check on [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/). It only shows framework specific errors, which can not be corrected.

## 4.3 Soure Code Citation

#### \_placeholders.scss

_Line 11_

```
object-fit: cover;
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Object-fit | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/) as shown below:

```
object-fit: cover;
```

- [Object-fit | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/)'s Code was used as I was looking for a way to contain an image in the given container irrespective of size.

#### _app-routing.module.ts_

_Lines 49_

```
RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled' })
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Introduce Router Scroller in Angular v6.1](https://medium.com/lacolaco-blog/introduce-router-scroller-in-angular-v6-1-ef34278461e9) as shown below:

```
    RouterModule.forRoot(routes, {
      scrollPositionRestoration: 'enabled',
      anchorScrolling: 'enabled',
      scrollOffset: [0, 64] // [x, y]
    })
```

- The code in [Introduce Router Scroller in Angular v6.1](https://medium.com/lacolaco-blog/introduce-router-scroller-in-angular-v6-1-ef34278461e9) was implemented by finding the new configuration to scroll to the top on every route load.
- [Introduce Router Scroller in Angular v6.1](https://medium.com/lacolaco-blog/introduce-router-scroller-in-angular-v6-1-ef34278461e9)'s Code was used because the new component was getting loaded with the previous scroll position. It should go to the top for every new route.
- [Introduce Router Scroller in Angular v6.1](https://medium.com/lacolaco-blog/introduce-router-scroller-in-angular-v6-1-ef34278461e9)'s Code was modified by extracting the `scrollPositionRestoration` key.

#### products.component.scss

_Lines 08 - 15_

```
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-columns: max-content;
  grid-auto-flow: dense;
  grid-auto-rows: minmax(250px, auto);
  grid-gap: 2rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, auto));
}
```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Parthsw - CSS Grid](https://github.com/parthsw/css-grid/blob/master/image-grid/index.css) as shown below:

```
.container{
    display:grid;
    grid-gap: 5px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit,minmax(150px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-rows: 75px;
    grid-auto-flow: dense;
}
```

- [Parthsw - CSS Grid](https://github.com/parthsw/css-grid/blob/master/image-grid/index.css)'s Code was used as a refresher to CSS grid syntax.
- [Parthsw - CSS Grid](https://github.com/parthsw/css-grid/blob/master/image-grid/index.css)'s Code was modified by understanding the CSS grid layout created for reponsive image tiles and was adapted in Products tile grid.
